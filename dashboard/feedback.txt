1) What steps did you take to figure out what you were going to focus on for 
the assignment?

First I've focussed on which communication protocol would be best to use given
the requirements (e.g. REST vs Websocket), and then I've looked which available
frameworks there where available in order speedup development. This made me
opt for the socket.io framework. After that I've prepared the environment
at which the various services (i.e. frontend dashboard app, backend server app
and drone simulation app) would run by using tools I'm familiar with and I 
think fit the balena.io technology stack (nginx, Docker, node, react).

3) About how long did you spend on it?

Around 4h coding and 1h of research. I spend slightly longer than set out 
originally for the assignent, however I found it quite interesting to dive and 
learn more about the socket.io framework as I haven't used it before.

4) If you had more time, what would you do?

- Add more unit-tests as the current code only contains a minimal nr. of tests.
- Add more comments / documentation to the dronecomm server application.
- Add SSL and perform e2e testing on a live webserver.
